    "\"\"\"1 ans) In Python, the open() function is used to open a file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The open() function takes two arguments: the name of the file to open and the mode in which to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file in Python are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "r: read mode\n",
    "This mode opens the file for reading. It is the default mode. If the file does not exist, it will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "w: write mode\n",
    "This mode opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, its contents will be truncated (i.e., cleared). If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "a: append mode\n",
    "This mode opens the file for writing, but appends any new data to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "x: exclusive creation mode\n",
    "This mode opens the file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, an error will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "b: binary mode\n",
    "This mode opens the file in binary mode, which is used for non-text files (e.g., images, audio files, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "t: text mode\n",
    "This mode opens the file in text mode, which is used for text files (e.g., .txt files).\n",
    "\n",
    "These modes can be used in combination to create different behaviors when opening a file. For example, to open a file in write mode and text mode, you can use \"wt\". \n",
    "To open a file in read mode and binary mode, you can use \"rb\".\"\"\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Free up system resources: When you open a file, the operating system allocates system resources to manage the file.\n",
    "If you do not close the file, these system resources will remain allocated, even if you are not actively using the file. \n",
    "Closing the file releases these resources, which helps to conserve system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write data to disk: When you write data to a file, it is not necessarily written to disk immediately.\n",
    "Instead, it is usually buffered in memory and written to disk in batches.\n",
    "When you close the file, any remaining data in the buffer is written to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure data integrity: If you do not close a file after writing data to it, \n",
    "there is a risk that the data may become corrupted or incomplete.\n",
    "This can happen if the program terminates unexpectedly or if the system crashes."
